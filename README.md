## Installation
You will have to have Node installed to run this program. In addition to Node you will need the Inquirer, MySQL, and console.table packages installed in the folder. You can do this by typing "npm install" in the terminal.

## Usage
Once everything is installed you just have to run the command "node index.js" in the terminal and you will be given options for how you can alter the database.
